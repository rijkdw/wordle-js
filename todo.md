# Things to do

- Prohibit re-guessing past words (because why would you do that to yourself)
- Back button to navigate to my portfolio home screen ([`rijkdewet.co.za`](rijkdewet.co.za))
- Separate `script.ts` into multiple files (recombine upon compilation)
  - one for each MVC component
  - utils
  - constants

# Issues to fix

- Can "resubmit" a winning word to replay the animation
- Can "enter" words after the board is full
